## Description
This is the last project made for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The goal was to develop a single page (accessibble and available offline) application featuring a map of a neighborhood with extra functionality added to this map (markers, info windows, third-party data etc.). The app uses React.js with Google Maps API, Zomato API, as well as react-google-maps, react-streetview and escape-string-regexp packages. The complete list of dependencies can be found below.

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, so all dependencies will be automatically installed.

To get started you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Then:

* clone this git repository 
`$ git clone git@github.com:a-czer-a/UFEND-Project-8--Neighborhood-Map.git` or download a zipped file
* go to the directory with downloaded or cloned project files
* install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* use command line `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the application in a new browser tab/window (this will start the development server). By default server runs on port 3000.
